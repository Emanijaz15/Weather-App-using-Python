# Weather-App-using-Python
This is a command-line Weather Application built in Python that allows users to check real-time weather information for any city in the world. It fetches weather data from the WeatherAPI (https://www.weatherapi.com/) and displays current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and local time for the selected city.
